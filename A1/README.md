Assignment 1

1. In order to run my source code, just type python3.6 user.py and you will be able to see the progress of the different parts of the HW being completed. There are 4 different text files Part1.txt, Part2.txt, Part3.1.txt, and Part3.2.txt containing the information.
2. The version of Python is python 3.6. 

Note: Collecting the 50 tweets of the geographic region for Part3.2.txt takes a very long time because it is using streaming from real time tweets. I'd recommend using ctrl-c if you don't want to wait as tweets usually come in slowly like 1 per 10 seconds (depends on time of day).
