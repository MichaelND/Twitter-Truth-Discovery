Assignment 3

1. For Part1, in order to run my source code, just type python3.6 user.py. You will be prompted with what file you want to run with my program and also whether you want d to be random (Part1) or d to be equal to 0.5 (Part2). Type the file you want and then type 1 and then the output will be sent to output.txt.

For Part2, in order to run my code. You need to make the sensing matrix from the cluster of tweets. Simply type python3.6 cluster_to_matrix.py and the program will generate the sensing matrix cluster_matrix.txt. Then run python3.6 user.py and when prompted with what file, enter cluster_matrix.txt and then when asked whether you want part1 or part2, type 2.

Note: 
test1.txt, test2.txt, test3.txt are the three test Sensing Matrix files
GroundTruth.txt is the Ground Truth File
MatrixFile.txt is the Sensing Matrix File

2. The version of Python is python 3.6.
